## Usage
Its a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
WHEN user will open the planner
THEN the current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN user scrolls down
THEN user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN user views the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
WHEN user click into a timeblock
THEN user can enter an event
WHEN user clicks the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved even if user refreshes the page.
